Hi, this program can read assembly code.

Opcodes table from opcodes.c file contains table of opcodes with their names (as strings), pointers to their functions and count of arguments.

Instruction can be:
mov eax,5
mov ebx, 6
Instruction can't be:
moveax,5



Max size of each argument (in symbols) is 31.
Max count of arguments is 2.

Executable program have 65535 bytes of memory.
First 128 bytes are reserved by program
